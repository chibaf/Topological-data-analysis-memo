### scikit-tda/ripser.py: A Lean Persistent Homology Library for Python https://github.com/scikit-tda/ripser.py

Ripser.py

Ripser.py is a lean persistent homology package for Python. Building on the blazing fast C++ Ripser package as the core computational engine, Ripser.py provides an intuitive interface for

computing persistence cohomology of sparse and dense data sets,

visualizing persistence diagrams,

computing lowerstar filtrations on images, and

computing representative cochains.

Additionally, through extensive testing and continuous integration, Ripser.py is easy to install on Mac, Linux, and Windows platforms.

To aid your use of the package, we've put together a large set of notebooks that demonstrate many of the features available. Complete documentation about the package can be found at ripser.scikit-tda.org.
